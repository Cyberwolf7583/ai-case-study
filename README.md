*B.) How is your company performing based on these metrics?* 
    [^7] **B.) A core metric used by Boston Dynamics is mobility and agility in robotic movement. Boston Dynamics is known for developing robots that can navigate complex environments, so they focus heavily on metrics that assess how well their robots can perform tasks. Boston Dynamics has made strides in becoming more customer-centric by enhancing its robotic solutions for various industries, particularly through the success of its Spot and Stretch robots. The company's focus is on improving operational efficiency and safety for its customers, with significant upgrades to hardware and software in 2023. For example, Spot, Boston Dynamics' agile mobile robot, has been utilized for over a million automated data captures, aiding companies like Purina in predictive maintenance tasks across multiple sites. This capability allows for efficient visual, thermal, and acoustic inspections, which helps customers prevent equipment failures and optimize operations.**

*A.) How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?*
    [^8] **A.) Boston Dynamics continues to be a leader in robotics, particularly with their well-known quadruped robot, Spot, and humanoid robot, Atlas.
